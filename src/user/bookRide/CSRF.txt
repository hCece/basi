Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can trick a user 
into unintentionally performing an action on a website or web application without their knowledge or consent.
This is typically done by exploiting the user's authenticated session on the targeted website.

For example, imagine you are logged into your bank's website and the website has a "Transfer Funds" feature.
An attacker could create a website or email with malicious code that automatically submits a transfer funds
request to your bank's website when you visit the attacker's website or click on a link in their email.
If you have an active session on your bank's website, the request will be sent using your authenticated
credentials and the transfer will be completed without your knowledge or consent.
